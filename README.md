A Django powered React/Redux application consuming a Django REST Framework API for Hedge Fund Manager Analytics.

The REACT application uses a combination of DRF CSRF Token Authentication and Django "out of the box" authentication to allow both in house configuration of the application by system administrators as well as use of the application on a non-admin basis.

Very much a work in progress.
